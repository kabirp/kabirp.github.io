I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/tcs/), advised by [Eran Tromer](https://cs-people.bu.edu/tromer/).

### Research Interests

My research focuses on **probabilistic proof systems**, namely **SNARGs** (succinct non-interactive arguments). My recent work also includes **property testing** and the co-design of **homomorphic encryption** and **verifiable computation** protocols.

### Background

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at several cryptography startups, including [Proven](https://www.proven.tools/) and [Irreducible](https://www.irreducible.com/).

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science (with an additional major in Mathematics) from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020.
