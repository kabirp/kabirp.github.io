I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/tcs/), under the supervision of [Prof. Eran Tromer](https://cs-people.bu.edu/tromer/).

### Research Interests

My research focuses on **probabilistic proof systems**, namely **SNARGs** (succinct non-interactive arguments). My recent work also includes **property testing** and the co-design of **homomorphic encryption** and **verifiable computation** protocols.

### Background

Prior to my Ph.D., I was a software engineer at the cryptography startups [Proven](https://www.proven.tools/) and [Irreducible](https://www.irreducible.com/).

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science (with an additional major in Mathematics) from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020.

### Acknowledgments

My path from industry to academia was made possible by many incredible people, and I am especially grateful to a few of them:

- I learned immensely from [**Jim Posen**](https://x.com/jimpo_potamus) and [**Ben Diamond**](https://benediamond.github.io/) at Irreducible.
- [**Prof. Nick Spooner**](https://spooner.cc/), visiting NYU in 2023-2024, generously made time for me, which was my first experience with academic research.
- A huge thank you is owed to [**Prof. Anil Ada**](https://www.pandanotes.org/servers/anil/), my main mentor throughout my undergrad. His course is what inspired my interest in theoretical computer science.
