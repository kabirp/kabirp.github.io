I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/tcs/), advised by [Eran Tromer](https://cs-people.bu.edu/tromer/).

My work so far has largely focused on probabilistic proof systems, namely SNARGs (succinct non-interactive arguments).
Lately, I have worked on property testing and explored co-design of homomorphic encryption and verifiable computation protocols.

Before Boston University, I worked as a software engineer at a few interesting (now defunct) startups, including [Proven](https://www.proven.tools/) and [Irreducible](https://www.irreducible.com/).

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science with an additional major in Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020.
